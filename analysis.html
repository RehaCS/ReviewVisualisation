			<h1 class="text-center mt-3">Analysis Of Visualizations</h1>
			<p class="text-center mx-5 px-5 mt-3 lead">Now that we've seen all of the visualizations, we can compare the visualizations of the benign applications with the fraudulent ones. In this page, we will discuss whether they show a significant difference and how they can help you differentiate between real or fake applications/reviews when you're next in the Google Apps store. While each of these alone may not be enough to label an application/review as fake, a combination of these will definitely mean that you should proceed with caution.</p>

			<div class="mx-5 px-5 mt-4 text-center">
				<h4>Number of reviews posted overtime</h4>
				<p>Looking at the visualizations, it can be seen that the benign reviews have a more consistent number of reviews posted over a period of time. On the other hand, the fraudulent ones have more inconsistencies regarding how the number of reviews is distributed over the days. When trying to determine if an application is genuine, take a look at how their reviews are dispersed. The more fluctuation you see with the number of reviews posted over a period of time, the more scrutiny the application warrants.</p>

				<h4>Distribution of ratings</h4>
				<p>It can be seen from the visualizations for the distribution of ratings, that the fraudulent side tends to have a larger ratio of 100% ratings compared to the benign applications. The ratings for these are more evenly distributed and have a larger percentage of the lower ratings. So look at the number of users giving a specific rating for the applications. While it may mean that the application is genuinely good, more likely it could point to the application as being fake-especially if you've spotted a combination of the other methods we've looked at. Nothing is perfect.</p>

				<h4>Length of reviews and Average length of reviews</h4>
				<p>The general pattern that can be seen here is that the benign apps have more scattered review lengths. In contrast, the fradulent have a lower line of best fit implying that fake comments are usually short and reusable. It can be seen that fraudulent applcations have and overall lower number of characters in their reviews. So look out for application with comments containing only a few words.</p>

				<h4>Word Cloud</h4>
				<p>This visualization was the most difficult to see a difference in. The expectation was that the fraudlent reviews will have specific words that are used more frequently and that they will differ from the benign reviews. In the visualozations, the most frequent word across all the applications is "Game" and fraudulent reviews often have the title of the application written. This may be an indicator that fake review bots are at play and getting smarter as they are learning how to make reviews seem more genuine. As a general rule, look out for reviews that are very vague and ones that don't relate to the application its under.</p>
